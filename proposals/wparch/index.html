This document outlines the Web Payments Architecture by introducing readers
to the goals of the architecture, messages, roles, and information flow in
the system. Links to specifications that detail each aspect of the
architecture in more detail are also provided for implementers.

  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>
This document outlines the Web Payments Architecture. It starts by highlighting
the goals of the architecture, then covers the primary types of messages
exchanged and the roles of participants in the system. An example use case
is then used to demonstrate how roles in the system communicate. Finally,
specifications that detail each aspect of the architecture in more detail
are also provided for implementers.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2 id="goals">Web Payments Architecture Goals</h2>

  <p>
The Web Payments architecture strives to support fundamental Web principles
by:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Adhering to Web architecture fundamentals</li>
    <li>Supporting network and device independence</li>
    <li>Providing accessibility for payers and payees with disabilities</li>
    <li>Being machine-readable where possible to enable automation and engagement of non-human entities</li>
    <li>Protecting the privacy of all participants</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
In addition to the fundamental Web principles above, the Web Payments
architecture also strives to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Improve the interface experience for all stakeholders</li>
    <li>Provide stakeholders with unencumbered knowledge and choice when undertaking a payment</li>
    <li>Support a wide spectrum of security and privacy needs to meet industry expectations</li>
    <li>Support existing payment schemes while enabling new ones</li>
    <li>Encourage efficient settlement</li>
    <li>Facilitate compliance with legal and regulatory obligations</li>
    <li>Enable monetization on the spectrum of Web to native apps</li>
    <li>Bridge distributed value networks</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Structure of Payment Messages</h2>

  <p>
A payment instruction is composed of the following parts:
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong><em>Instruction Type</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
The type of transaction that should be executed if the message is processed.
Examples include: request, subscription, hold, and refund.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong><em>Payment Method</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
The requested mechanism to be used for processing the payment. Examples include:
credit card, ACH, SEPA, and Bitcoin.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong><em>Transaction Details</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
Specific information pertaining to the transaction. Examples include: price,
transaction reference number, and items being purchased.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong><em>Transaction Options</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
A set of information that needs to be collected from the payer in order for
the transaction to be fulfilled. Examples include: shipping options,
requests for shipping address, and requests for contact information.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  </figure>

  <p>
A payment response is composed of the following parts:
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong><em>Payment Method</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
The selected mechanism that was used for processing the payment. Examples
include: credit card, ACH, SEPA, and Bitcoin.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong><em>Transaction Details</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
Specific information pertaining to the transaction. Examples include:
transaction reference number, price, and items purchased.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong><em>Response Details</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
Information that pertains to the result of processing the payment including
all information requested in the initial payment instruction. Examples include:
selected shipping option, shipping address, and contact email.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>Roles in the Architecture</h2>

  <p>
An architecture for web payments must distinguish the essential
roles of core actors and the relationships between them; how do they interact?
A role is an abstraction that might be implemented in many different ways. The
separation of roles suggests likely interfaces and/or protocols for
standardization. The following roles exist in the Web Payments
Architecture:
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong><em>Payer</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
An entity transmitting value to the Payee.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong><em>Payee</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
An entity receiving value from the Payer.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong><em>Mediator</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
Routes payment instructions between the Payee and the Payment App.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong><em>Payment App</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
Processes payment instructions sent via the Mediator and returns
payment responses to the Mediator. It may communicate with Payment Networks
to execute a payment instruction or it may return data so that another
entity can execute a payment instruction.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong><em>Payment Network</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
A system that is responsible for transferring value from one entity to another.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <figure>
    <img style="margin: auto; display: block;" src="architecture.svg">
    <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
- Roles in the Web Payments architecture
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
As the diagram above depicts, the Web Payments architecture separates the
following concerns:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
The role that creates the payment instruction (Payee) is separated from the
role that routes the payment instruction to the entity that will process it
(Mediator).
    </li>
    <li>
The role that routes the payment instruction (Mediator) is separated from
the role that processes the payment instruction (Payment App).
    </li>
    <li>
The role that processes the payment instruction/response
(Payment App/Payee) is separated from the role that transfers the value
associated with the instruction/response (Payment Network).
    </li>
  </ul>

<section>
  <h2>An Exemplary Use Case</h2>

  <p>
In order to understand how all of the actors and roles in the ecosystem
interact, consider the following use case:
  </p>

  <p>
Quinn would like to purchase a new laptop using her new security-enhanced
credit card.
  </p>

  <h3>Payer Registers Payment App</h3>

  <p>
In order for Quinn (Payer) to use her new security-enhanced credit card, she
must enroll it via her bank's website (Payment App).
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img style="margin: auto; display: block;" src="flow-register.svg">
    <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
- The Payer Registers a New Payment App
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h3>Payer Makes a Purchase</h3>

  <p>
Quinn (Payer) finds the laptop she wants on a website (Payee). She
clicks "Buy", selects the information necessary to complete the transaction,
and is notified that her purchase is successful and is on its way.
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img style="margin: auto; display: block;" src="flow-purchase.svg">
    <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
