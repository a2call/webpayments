  <p>
This document specifies the core Web Payments messages that are used to
initiate and acknowledge a payment request. The messages are typically passed
between the software ecosystem that inititates, executes, and finalizes
Web Payments.
  </p>

  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>
When requesting and fulfilling a payment on the Web, a number of messages
need to be passed between various parties to execute the movement of funds.
This specification details those core messages and provides instructions on
how to interpret those messages in a variety of operating environments.
  </p>

  <section class="informative">
    <h2>How to Read this Document</h2>

    <p>This document is detailed specification for a set of core messages
    related to initiating, executing, and finalizing payments on the Web.
    The document is primarily intended for the following audiences:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Software developers who want to understand the design decisions and
        structure of the core messages.</li>
      <li>Software developers who want to implement Web Payments systems.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="normative">
    <h3>Terminology</h3>

  <p class="issue">
The terminology in this specification's terminology and messages need to be
updated to match the
<a href="https://github.com/w3c/webpayments/wiki/A-Payments-Initiation-Architecture-for-the-Web">Payments Architecture document</a>.

  <h2>The Data Model</h2>

  <p class="issue">
The data model used for the messages in this specification is intended to be
flexible enough to work with a variety of concrete syntaxes. Some of the
more formal software designers may find this disconcerting as types and
ranges are not strictly locked down at the data model layer. Others will find
the need for an abstract data model unnecessary, preferring to express the
messages in a more concrete syntax. Some may want to use UML, others may want
RDF, and others may prefer JSON's data model. In short, the data model is up
for discussion. The only requirement is that we use something that's flexible
enough to work with a variety of programming environments while empowering
developers to use validation tooling (like JSON Schema) if the facility is
available to them.
  </p>

  <p>
When designing software systems, the fundamental data model used to express
the components of the system is important. Data models tend to vary in their
formalism. Some data models are quite abstract. For example, data values are
not typed and only vaguely defined as to what their allowable values may be.
Other data models are quite formal, with strongly defined value types and
ranges.
  </p>

  <p>
The data model used to document the messages in this specification tends
toward being more abstract and less formal while enabling data validation
tools to be utilized if available. This is accomplished by providing the
general description of the message in the abstract data model and the
allowed value types and ranges via tooling for the concrete syntax (e.g.
using JSON Schema for Web Payments Core Messages expressed as JSON).
  </p>

  <p>
What follows is a simple example of a
<code>HelloWorld</code> message definition:
  </p>

<h5 style="font-size: 1.2em">HelloWorld</h5>

  <p>
A message that is used to greet the world.
  </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><code>title</code></dt>
        <dd>
A short human-readable title for the message.
        </dd>
        <dt><code>message</code></dt>
        <dd>
The message text itself.
        </dd>
      </dl>

  <p>
Note that there are no formal constraints placed on the message definition
in the abstract data model. Constraints are typically placed on the values
using general techniques available to programming environments for each
concrete syntax (e.g. JSON Schema in most JSON environments). These constraints
can be found in the sections titled
<a href="#expressing-messages-as-webidl">Expressing Messages as WebIDL</a>,
<a href="#expressing-messages-as-json">Expressing Messages as JSON</a>, and
<a href="#expressing-messages-as-json-ld">Expressing Messages as JSON-LD</a>.

value.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt><code><dfn>currency</dfn></code></dt>
        <dd>
<code>currency</code> is a string containing a three-character alphaneumeric
code for the currency as defined by [[!ISO4217]] or a URL for a currency
identifier. For example, <code>"USD"</code> for US Dollars or
<code>"https://example.com/currencies/experimental-XYZ"</code> for a new
experimental currency.
        </dd>
        <dt><code><dfn>amount</dfn></code></dt>
        <dd>
A string containing the decimal monetary value. The string MUST use a single
U+002E FULL STOP character as the decimal separator. The string MUST begin
with a single U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS character if the value is negative. All
other characters must be characters in the range U+0030 DIGIT ZERO (0) to
U+0039 DIGIT NINE (9).
<div class="note">
The string should match the regular expression
<code>^-?[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$</code>.
</div>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>The following example shows how to represent $55.00 US Dollars.</p>
      <pre class="example highlight" title="$55 US Dollars expressed as JSON">
{
  "amount": "55.00",

a set of <a>FinancialAmount</a>s that express the desired amount in
different currencies.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <pre class="example highlight"
        title="Payment for $4.35 USD may be fulfilled using non-tokenized Visa and Mastercard expressed as JSON">
{
  "paymentMethod": ["VisaLegacy", "MasterCardLegacy"],
  "paymentAmount": {
    "amount": "4.35",
    "currency": "USD"
}
      </pre>

<section>
  <h2>Core Messages</h2>

    <section>
      <h3><dfn>PaymentRequest</dfn></h3>

      <p>
A <a><code>PaymentRequest</code></a> expresses a payment that is requested
by a <a>payee</a>.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt><code>type</code></dt>
        <dd>
A set of one or more type identifiers associated with the object, typically

in the future to, for example, add things like
<code>"SubscriptionRequest"</code> to identify payment requests that may
have some recurring quality to them.
</div>
        </dd>
        <dt><code>description</code></dt>
        <dd>
A human-readable description of the reason the payment request was initiated.
This text MAY be displayed to the <a>payer</a> in a payment interface.
For example, <code>"Payment for widgets from Acme Anvil Emporium"</code>.
        </dd>
        <dt><code>acceptablePayment</code></dt>
        <dd>
One or more <a>AcceptablePaymentMethod</a>s that the <a>payee</a> will
accept as payment.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <pre class="example highlight"
        title="An example of a payment request expressed in JSON">

        <dd>
An type identifier associated with the object, typically set to
<code>"PaymentAcknowledgement"</code>.

<div class="issue">
The set of available types MAY be extended in the future to add things
like <code>Receipt</code> to identify acknowledgements that contain
receipt information.
</div>
        </dd>
        <dt><code>description</code></dt>
        <dd>
Human readable text that will be used to identify what the payment was for.

<code>"Payment to ExampleMerch for widgets"</code>.
        </dd>
        <dt><code>payment</code></dt>
        <dd>
Information such as the payment method used and the payment amount. Payment
method specific information, such as the status of the payment, may also be
included. The presence and meaning of this extra information is dependent on
the payment method. The payment information may be used by the <a>payee</a> or
their associated <a>payment service provider</a> to, for example, finalize a
payment or display information to the <a>payer</a>.
        </dd>
      </dl>

    <h2>Expressing Messages as JSON-LD</h2>

    <p class="issue">
One proposal for providing message extensibility is to allow messages to
be interpreted as JSON-LD with a specific context, such as
<code>https://example.org/contexts/web-payments/v1</code>. Doing this would
not only solve message versioning, but it would also enable
decentralized extensibility for all payment messages while ensuring that
there are no clashes in terminology between industry verticals.
